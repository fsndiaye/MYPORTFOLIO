    <h1> MI PIZZA PROGRESS </h1>
    <div class="container">
        <div class="item2"><img src="Portfolio.Images/MiPizzaScreenshot 2 (22).jpg">
            <p class="p1">By wanting to put the radio buttons in place, I realized that in fact it was displayed inline and it was not the desired result. So I stopped to see the problem.
            Indeed I had not used the /br/ tag, Break . To be able to have my radio buttons arranged vertically.
            I then fixed it using /br/ to get the desired design.

            <p class="p1"> I had a little problem over here beacuse i added the price on my p tag at the first place . I wanted all prices to be be displayed vertically one after another . So decided to add a class for the pricing and work on the display method on my style sheet.

            <p class="p1"> My radio buttons was displayed after the size of pizza for some reason; At the first Place I deleled the div class and write the code again because i was thinkimg that something may be wrong inside the div but i figure out later that i had to set a position absolute for the container class and relative  my radio class so I can style it .

            <p class="p1"> I messed up with my code by trying to add a textarea on my 2nd grid 
                so I will be able to display the information after coding the JS part.
                But this was before having a critical thinking about it . i realize that I don't need a text area
                because it is not used to display information but to enter some text.
